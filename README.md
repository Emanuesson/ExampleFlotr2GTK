General Information
===================

This is a minimum demonstration to show the possibility of including Flotr2 into gtk+3 via webkit2.

Compilation
-----------

Simply use the autotools to compile everything... so as under Posix:
```shell
autoreconf -fi
mkdir build && cd build
../configure && make
./testbin
```
Example
-----------

Just a small screenshot to show how the working test binary should look like:
